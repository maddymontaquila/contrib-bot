<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->
- [ ] Clarify Project Requirements
	<!-- Ask for project type, language, and frameworks if not specified. Skip if already provided. -->

- [ ] Scaffold the Project
	<!--
	Call project setup tool with projectType and language parameters.
	Run scaffolding command to create project files and folders.
	Use '.' as the working directory.
	-->

- [ ] Customize the Project
This app is orchestrated with .NET Aspire. Everything runs from one CLI command - `aspire run`. Adding packages to the Aspire AppHost should use `aspire add`. The project includes both a TypeScript Discord bot and a .NET Aspire AppHost for orchestration. Always use the latest Aspire documentation Learn MCP first, then Context7 second.

- [ ] Install Required Extensions
	<!-- Use extension installer tool if requiredExtensions is defined in project setup. -->

- [ ] Compile the Project
	<!--
	Install any missing dependencies.
	Run diagnostics and resolve any issues.
	Check for markdown files in project folder for relevant instructions on how to do this.
	-->

- [ ] Create and Run Task
	<!-- Create task based on package.json, README.md, and project structure. -->

- [ ] Launch the Project
	<!-- Prompt user for debug mode, launch only if confirmed. -->

- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	Verify README.md exists and is up to date. Do not create separate documentation.

## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If vscode_manageTodoList tool is available, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Always start executing the plan by calling the tool to get the project template.
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Do not create folders unless user instructs.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Codeâ€”do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- Do not print and explain the project structure to the user unless explicitly requested.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode. Do not attempt to move it yourself. And do not proceed with next steps.

EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- If the project setup lists requiredExtensions, use extension installer tool to check and install ALL the listed requiredExtensions before proceeding.

PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - The project is successfully created without errors.
  - The user has clear instructions on how to launch their code in debug mode within Visual Studio Code.
  - A copilot-instructions.md exists in the project root under the .github directory.
  - A README.md file in the root of the project is up to date.
  - A tasks.json file exists in the project root under the .vscode directory.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Completion = project scaffolded, copilot-instructions + README exist, task runnable, debug launch offered.

Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
-->
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
